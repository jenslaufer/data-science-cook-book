## Gaussian Naive Bayes

### Advantages

   - Simple
   - Less training data is needed
   - Naïve Bayes Classifier algorithm performs well when the input variables are categorical.
   - A Naïve Bayes classifier converges faster, requiring relatively little training data than other discriminative models like logistic regression, when the Naïve Bayes conditional independence assumption holds.
   - With Naïve Bayes Classifier algorithm, it is easier to predict class of the test data set. A good bet for multi class predictions as well.
   - Though it requires conditional independence assumption, Naïve Bayes Classifier has presented good performance in various application domains.

### Disadbantages

   - Problems when features are correlated


### Example

   - Spam filtering (https://www.dezyre.com/article/top-10-machine-learning-algorithms/202)
   - Document categorization

### When to use

   - If you have a moderate or large training data set.
   - If the instances have several attributes.
   - Given the classification parameter, attributes which describe the instances should be conditionally independent.

## Support Vector Machines (SVM)


### Advantages

   - SVM offers best classification performance (accuracy) on the training data.
   - SVM renders more efficiency for correct classification of the future data.
   - The best thing about SVM is that it does not make any strong assumptions on data.
   - It does not over-fit the data.

### Disadbantages

### Examples

SVM is commonly used for stock market forecasting by various financial institutions. For instance, it can be used to compare the relative performance of the stocks when compared to performance of other stocks in the same sector. The relative comparison of stocks helps manage investment making decisions based on the classifications made by the SVM learning algorithm.
